# ðŸ“Š Payroll Manager ðŸ“‘

The code uses HTML and CSS to create the forms. There are three CSS files included in the code to style the page.

It uses a JSON as a database, that means that when you reload the page, every employee and concept that you've created is deleted. That being said, its principal utility
is to facilitate to managers to make a payroll of each worker in a company.

It's remarkable to say that it shows only one table at the time (employees, concepts, payroll) using CSS and JS properties.

## Forms

### Create Employee Form
The "Create Employee" form allows a user to input data for a new employee. The user can select the employee's position from a dropdown menu and input the employee's name, last name, address, phone number, email, and ID.

### Create Concept Form
The "Create Concept" form allows a user to input data for a new concept. The user can input the concept's name and select its type from a dropdown menu. The concept can be either a payout or discount.

### Asign Concept
It allows a user to asign a concept to an employee that it is already registered.

## How to Use
To use the forms, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. The forms will be displayed on the page. Fill out the required fields and click the "Create employee" or "Create concept" button to submit the form.
